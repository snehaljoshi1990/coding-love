Algorithm: A sequence of steps to solve a specific problem or perform a task.

Variable: A named storage location in memory used to store data values that can be changed during program execution.

Data Type: A classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. Common data types include integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans.

Function: A named block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can take inputs, called parameters, and can return outputs.

Conditional Statement: A programming construct that performs different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false. Examples include if statements, else statements, and elif (else if) statements.

Loop: A programming construct that repeats a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met. Common types of loops include for loops and while loops.

Array/List: A data structure that can hold multiple values of the same type. Arrays/lists allow for efficient storage and manipulation of data.

String: A sequence of characters enclosed within quotation marks. Strings are used to represent text data in programming.

Comment: A non-executable piece of text within a program that provides information or explanations about the code. Comments are ignored by the compiler or interpreter.

Variable Scope: The region of a program where a variable is accessible. Scope determines where in the program a variable can be used.

Debugging: The process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in a program.

Syntax: The set of rules that define the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs in a given programming language.

Compilation: The process of translating code written in a high-level programming language into machine code that can be executed by a computer.

Interpretation: The process of executing code written in a high-level programming language by translating it into machine code line by line during runtime.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures, often referred to as methods.

These are just a few basic coding terminologies to get you started. There are many more terms and concepts in the world of programming!
